         This section will discuss the semantics of propositional logic.

        Meaning to $\mathcal{L}_1$-expressions is provided by $\mathcal{L}_1$-structures: they assign truth values to sentence letters.</p>

        <p>Although $\mathcal{L}_1$-structures are infinite lists of truth-values, we can process their relevant parts in LEAN. As an example, we consider here an $\mathcal{L}_1$ structure which assigns falsity to sentence letters $P$, $Q$, and truth to $R$. You can see this in the code editor. 
        By applying the definition of satisfaction, you can now evaluate the truth value of compound sentences. 
        Just like as you would do with truth tables, LEAN computes the value of complex sentences.</p> 

        <p>INSTRUCTIONS:
        <ol>
            <li>If you click on the #eval statements <i>and your sentence is well-formed</i>, LEAN will evaluate the truth value of the compound sentences. In the lower half of the code editor under "Messages" you will see the truth value.</li>
            <li>Verify LEAN's evaluation for the given expressions using a truth table.</li>     
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        You have to be precise with your brackets in LEAN. If you use multiple connectives and don't specify the brackets, LEAN <b> automatically</b> adds brackets from left to right. 
        The first example shows this: if you input $P \land \neg P \lor R$, LEAN will evaluate $(P \land \neg P) \lor R$. 
        </p>
        <h3>Countermodels</h3>
        <p>
        We just looked at a toy model in the previous example, with given truth values for $P,Q,R$. 
        Next, let's consider countermodels. As a reminder, a sentence $\phi$ is logically implied by a set of sentences $\Gamma$ (formally $\Gamma \vDash \phi$) if there is no counterexample to the argument. 
        The next exercise is for you to define the values of P, Q and R such that the statements in the code editor are false. The task is to provide a countermodel. 
        You have to remove the -- lines in your code editor for your answer to be processed.
