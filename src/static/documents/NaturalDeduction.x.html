    <h2>Natural Deduction</h2>

  The next pages introduce the natural deduction rules for the connectives of propositional logic: 
  Conjunction ($\land$), Conditional ($\rightarrow$), Disjunction ($\lor$) and Negation ($\neg$).
  <p>
    You learn their LEAN implementation and can then automatically check your natural deduction derivations using LEAN. In the end there is a challenging exercise combining all the connectives.
